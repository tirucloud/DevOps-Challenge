# Day 3: Jenkins CI/CD

## Goal: Build automation pipeline with Jenkins

✅ Install Jenkins (or use Docker)

✅ Create freestyle and pipeline jobs

✅ Write Jenkinsfile (Declarative Pipeline)

✅ Trigger jobs via GitHub Webhooks

Hands-on:

- Setup Jenkins for a simple Node.js app with test/build/deploy stages

- Parameterized jobs, build history, artifacts
