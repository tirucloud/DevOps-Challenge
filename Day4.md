# Day 4: Kubernetes + Helm

## Goal: Understand orchestration and manage K8s workloads

✅ K8s core concepts (Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets)

✅ kubectl, k9s, namespaces, contexts

✅ Helm: install charts, create custom chart

Hands-on:

- Deploy app to local (minikube or kind) or cloud cluster

- Use Helm to install and upgrade your app
